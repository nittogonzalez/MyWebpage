*Hello my name is Nitto Gonzalez and I want to learn how to program efficiently.

I have been messing with programming and programming adjacent activities for a
while now but now that I have graduated I want to take it more seriously. 
My major in college was Management information systems focused in Cyber so I
also want to work on some cybersecurity projects, but this will be my starting point
where I will store all of my certifications and projects that I do.*

*This website will hold all of my projects, certifications, and education 
achievements. 
I want it to have a contact page and an about me page.
I am also following the odin project curriculum while making this website so there 
will be multiple iterations*
